            <h4>At Altitude Consultancy, we believe that ‘what got you to Rs. 100 crores will not take you to Rs. 1,000
                crores’.
                Scaling-up the enterprise requires a completely different mindset, a different skill set and very
                different management systems in comparison to the ‘build-up’ stage of an enterprise. We will share our
                experience of achieving a 100X growth in a span of 15 years with you. We will help you build a shared
                vision, a shared strategy. A vision and a strategy which your team will own as much as you do. So that
                the execution is smooth. And the growth is sustainable.</h4><br><br>

                crores in 2003 to 4000+ crores in 2018.</h4><br><br>
            <h4>He understands that there is nothing more powerful than being able to build a cohesive team where the
                members share the vision of the leader, understand the strategy and have their goals clearly aligned to
                the organisation goals.</h4><br><br>
